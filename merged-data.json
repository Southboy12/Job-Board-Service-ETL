You can view more on our Benefits here, but as a further insight on how we look after our people, we offer the following support and opportunities:\n\n   Salary: £35,000 - £45,000\n\n   (Really) flexible and remote working: most companies say they offer flexible working, but they've never experienced flexible working at Intuita. We trust you to work in the way that suits you best and offer flexible hours and part-time roles to fit your lifestyle. We have three UK offices in Newbury, London and Liverpool, which you're welcome to work from as much or as little as you like, but we also organise regular social events at each office to ensure we maintain our close-knit feel.\n\n   Care for your health and wellbeing: we genuinely care about the wellbeing of our team. We offer comprehensive company-paid medical insurance, free therapy and mental health support via Spill, a team of in-house Mental Health First Aiders, plus financial education and consultations.\n\n   Incredible training and learning opportunities: our team is full of talented individuals who are genuine experts in what they do. You'll get to work alongside them and learn from the best, as well as boosting your skills and knowledge with our knowledge sharing sessions, mentoring and company-paid certifications.\n\n✨ Freedom and empowerment: we allow our consultants to actually be consultants, not just bodies. You're given the responsibility and accountability to really own problems and are encouraged to explore new directions and opportunities. There are no glass ceilings here and we don't have salary or promotion review dates - we reward people as and when we see good work.\n\n       A supportive, friendly team: we work hard but enjoy working hard together. We're a diverse and inclusive team who enjoy silly Slack conversations and regular social events, and our relatively flat structure means that everyone has an equal voice.\n\nIf you like the sound of Intuita, apply to join us today!
